## Workspace.getLeaf() method

If newLeaf is false (or not set) then an existing leaf which can be navigated is returned, or a new leaf will be created if there was no leaf available.

If newLeaf is `'split'` then a new leaf will be created adjacent to the currently active leaf.

If newLeaf is `'window'` then a popout window will be created with a new leaf inside.
