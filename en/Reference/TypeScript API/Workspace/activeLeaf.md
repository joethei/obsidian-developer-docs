## Workspace.activeLeaf property

> Warning: This API is now obsolete.
> 
> - The use of this field is discouraged.
> 

Indicates the currently focused leaf, if one exists.

Please avoid using `activeLeaf` directly, especially without checking whether `activeLeaf` is null.

The recommended alternatives are: - If you need information about the current view, use . - If you need to open a new file or navigate a view, use .

**Signature:**

```typescript
activeLeaf: WorkspaceLeaf | null;
```
